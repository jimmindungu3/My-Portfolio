# James Ndung'u | Web Developer

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm James Ndung'u, a Full Stack Web Developer based in Nairobi, Kenya.

## About Me

I'm a Software Developer with a passion for building dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications. I graduated from a Full Stack Bootcamp at Moringa School in June 2024 and hold a BSc in Computer Security and Forensics. Currently, I am a TVET Trainer at Thika TTI. 

On a personal note, I enjoy riding and cycling, which I find therapeutic after long days behind a screen. I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring, and thinking about how to make things better.
